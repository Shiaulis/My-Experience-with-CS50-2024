# My experiece with CS50
In late 2023 I've decided to recap my knowledge of computer science, dig deeper into other areas of programming, learn more languages and tools in 2024. With that in mind my obvious choise was to start with (CS50)[https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science] â€“ one of the most popular courses that lot of people keep recommending over and over again. I gave a try for a couple of lectures of (CS50p)[https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/], but then swiched to more basic version with C, Python and HTML/CSS/JS. The newer version started on 1st of January 2024, so it was a perfect moment start.
Here I plane to leave my lecture notes as well as Problem Set solutions just for sake of history and to be able to refer to these materials in past. I also hope to make my own version of CS50 for children as well as mentoring version.
