During the study several languages will be introduced:
- C
- Python
- SQL
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

Students not learn particular language, but know who to program.
Learn how to represent
- numbers
- letters
- colors
- images
- videos
- audio
How to solve problems, write algorithms , write code.

Problem solving is a goal that reached by **computational thinking** (thinking like a computer).
Unary system is a system represented for example with our hand.
Computer speaks in binary system, based on 2 states: 0 and 1.
We can represent not only data with numbers but also instructions.
**Bit** represents 0 or 1
**Byte** represents 8 bites.

How do we represent letters? We agreed to represents letters with particular numbers. For example `A` represented by number `65`. It is represented in ASCII standard. It is American standards so it represents only latin symbols. For other languages Unicode is used. It uses 1/2/3/4 bytes. Unicode goal to represent all symbols from past, present in future. For compact representation Unicode is using base-16 system
How do we represent colors? RGB.
Same numbers will represent different things, depending on context.
Notes, music, videos are represented in a similar way.

Code – is implementation of algorithms.
Here goes an example to search for a contact in a contact book (Yellow pages).
We are using pseudocode to express logic of our program without writing any actual code.

LLP (large language models) infers from pattern what typical human can ask
# Scratch
- `say` is a function and text inside is a function parameter.

input → Algorithm → output

- return value - is something the function can return

[[hello.c]]
[[Growing plant.sb3]]
